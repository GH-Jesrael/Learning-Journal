Topic: Creating Custom Object with PSCustomObject

What I learned: 
- How to create a custom object using [PSCustomObject] and a hashtable.
- How to add properties to the custom object using dot notation.
- How to modify existing properties of the custom object.
- How to add methods to the custom object using Add-Member with ScriptMethod.
- How to remove properties from the custom object using PSObject.Properties.Remove method.
- PSCustomObject in PowerShell falls under scripting and automation tasking.

Thoughts:
- Creating custom objects with PSCustomObject provides a flexible and powerful way to manage data in PowerShell.
- The ability to dynamically add properties and methods makes PSCustomObject extremely versatile for scripting and automation tasks.
- I found it useful to explore different ways to manipulate custom objects and plan to implement these techniques in future projects.
