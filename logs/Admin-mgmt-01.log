**What I Learned**:

  - Command to create a new user: `net user [username] [password] /add`
  - Command to modify a user: `net user [username] [newpassword]`
  - Command to delete a user: `net user [username] /delete`

- **Assigning Administrator Roles**: Granting administrative privileges to user accounts.
  - Command to add a user to the Administrators group: `net localgroup administrators [username] /add`
  - Command to remove a user from the Administrators group: `net localgroup administrators [username] /delete`

- **Alternate Approach**: Using the Control Panel for user management.
  - **Creating a New User**:
    - Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Another Account > Add a new user in PC settings.
  - **Modifying a User**:
    - Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Another Account > Select the account > Make the changes you need.
  - **Deleting a User**:
    - Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Another Account > Select the account > Delete the account.
  - **Assigning Administrator Roles**:
    - Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Another Account > Select the account > Change the account. 

**Personal Reflections**:
- It's vital to manage user accounts efficiently to ensure system security and proper access control.
- Assigning administrator roles requires careful consideration to avoid unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
- The command prompt provides a powerful interface for managing user accounts with precision and speed.
